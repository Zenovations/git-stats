Just clone, copy `config.sample.js` to `config.js`, and [install](). Then run app.js and include the json in your project. See the example page for a sample of how you might use the output.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nThis tool is a [Zenovation](http://github.com/Zenovations) created created by Michael Wulf (@katowulf).\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble?
